This is an extension that was forked from:

https://github.com/tom-pollak/lazygit-vscode/tree/main

It is the same concept but for the TUI tool "jjui" for jujutsu vcs. 

Warning, I have not tested this extension extensively, and it was pretty much just changing the stuff from the lazygit-vscode extension to work with jjui, credits go to that author.
